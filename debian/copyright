Patches: 
The Debian version of Cyrus IMAP is heavily patched to adequate it to Debian,
and sometimes to add functionality.  All such patches are submitted upstream to
CMU, for proper inclusion in Cyrus -- but not all of them will be accepted, of
course.  See README.Debian for more details.  Also, many patches from the
current CVS release of Cyrus IMAPd are folded in Debian updates; these are
identified by "patchset" numbers, created by the cvsps utility.

The IPv6 patch by Hajimu UMEMOTO <ume@mahoroba.org> has been applied.

CMU release tarballs are often repacked minus the CVS/ directories to avoid
problems in my build system.
